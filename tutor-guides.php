          <h2>Concerns from Students</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          When asking students to conduct self and peer assessment, most of them resist. Such resistance is due to the following major reasons:
          <ul>
            <li>Most students think that their peers do not do the peer assessment fairly and responsibly.</li>
            <li>Students feel that do not have sufficient knowledge and skill to assess their peers' work.</li>
            <li>Students worry that if they gave low marks or negative comments to their classmates, their friendship with peers would be adversely affected.</li>
            <li>Students worry that if they gave low marks or negative comments to their classmates, their classmates might give low marks or negative comments to them as well.</li>
            <li>Students think that it is embarrassed to tell the others their mistakes or weaknesses.</li>
          </ul>
          Regarding to student presentation, many students do not pay attention to others’ presentation. Some of the reasons included:
          <ul>
            <li>The presentations of the other groups are not interesting.</li>
            <li>Students think that they cannot learn technical knowledge from the other groups' presentations.</li>
            <li>Students think that they cannot learn presentation and communication skills from the other groups' presentations.</li>
            <li>The other groups’ presentations are not important to study.</li>
          </ul>

        </div>
        <p>
          Although we only invite students to rank each presenting group, a good understanding of the assessment criteria that formulate the evaluation basis is useful. The followings are some exemplars for assessing group presentations. They are compiled from the literature and interviews with the academia. Tutors can select the criteria that can best reflect and assess the presentation task, and explain them to the students before they assess their peer’s presentations.

          <h2>Scoring Method of the Inter-group Peer Assessment</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          To avoid bias when students rating other groups’ performance, relative ranking will be used as the scoring method instead of absolute grading (or assigning mark). Each student has to give a rank to other groups in accordance to their relative performance. For example, assuming there are 5 groups of presentations (A, B, C, D and E), each group consists of 4 students. All students of group A has to give a rank to group B, C, D and E. The better the group performance, the higher would be the mark. As a result, student 1 of group A may give the following assessment results:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Group B – Rank 1: the best (4 marks will be assigned to Group B by the system);</li>
            <li>Group C – Rank 3 (2 marks will be assigned);</li>
            <li>Group D – Rank 2 (3 marks will be assigned) and</li>
            <li>Group E – Rank 4: the worst (1 mark will be assigned)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Following the tutor’s defined parameters, such as setting the upper and lower score limits and the penalty to students who do not performed peer assessment, a peer group mark will be calculated by the CAPP2 system automatically.

          <h2>Assessment Criteria for Intra-group Self And Peer Assessment</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          Students may have little exposure to self and peer assessment and so may lack the necessary skills and judgments to effectively manage these assessments. It is helpful to introduce students to the concepts and elements of assessment against specified criteria when you explain the presentation coursework. Students can also be invited to propose assessment criteria, which may improve their commitment. This requires taking time at the outset to discuss with the students what is expected, and to provide guidance on how to judge their own and others’ contributions. The following exemplars may serve as a good starting point for discussion with students or adaption in coursework.

          <h2>Scoring Method of Intra-group Self and Peer Assessment</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          Many scoring methods have been used by teachers when conducting peer and self-assessment. Most of them use likert scale from 5 (excellent) to 0 (unacceptable) or 3 (good) to 0 (not helpful). To enable students to rate their peers’ performance in a simple but precise manner, a 5-point scale ranging from 3 to -1 is implemented in the CAPP2 system. In the intra-group assessment, each student has to give a score to each member of his/her group, including the student himself/herself, for the contribution to each criterion. The highest score to be given is 3 and the lowest is -1, as below:
          <ul class="list-unstyled">
            <li>3 = better than most of the group in this respect</li>
            <li>2 = about average in this respect</li>
            <li>1 = not as good as most of the group in this respect</li>
            <li>0 = no help at all in this aspect</li>
            <li>-1 = a hindrance to the group in this respect</li>
          </ul>
          The marks awarded for each member will be used to calculate the individual mark for the project.
        </p>
        <p>Following the tutor’s defined parameters, including smoothening condition and penalty-setting to those students to do not perform self and/or peer assessments, a PA score (to individual student) will be calculated by the CAPP2 system automatically.</p>
